We are doing good on creator’s page and Guest’s page. For the part of creator’s page, we work on creating a view list of appointments. And we update some features like delete accounts, select time slots, and add description. Also, we did some changes in guest’s part. The big change is that we create a calender and let users to select available date in calendar. In the future, we try to use CSS to decorate our pages and add more and more features like add some restriction to users for security, forget passwords bottom and add some pictures to decorate our pages.
